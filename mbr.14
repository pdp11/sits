The PDP11 Memory Break Device (MB11)

	The MB11 is a PDP11 device which is intended to  aid
debugging machine language PDP11 programs. It may be set  to
"watch" for certain memory references and cause an  interrupt
to a  debugging routine  when they  occur. The  device  also
records the last  64 addresses which  were referenced;  when
the interrupt  condition occurs  this record  is "frozen"  so
that the 64  references imediately  preceeding the  interrupt
condition may be examined.
	The device is mainly useful for finding program bugs
which are extremely difficult to find with more conventional
techniques. One such class of bugs is the "who is clobbering
this location"  type  of  bug.  The device  may  be  set  to
interrupt  on  write  references  to  one  or  more   specfic
locations; when  the  interrupt  occurs  the  programmer  can
examine the history memory to determine why the the  program
was writing in the memory location in question.
	Another type of bug  which is normally difficult  to
find occurs when  the program  drops dead  at some  location
where it would not  be expected to be,  e.g. if the  program
jumps into  a  data  area. When  the  debugging  program  is
entered, it can immediately freeze the history memory, which
can then be examined  to determine how  the flow of  control
got to the unexpected point.
	The MB11 includes  the history  memory, the  history
memory count register, the X  and Y compare registers and  a
control  register.  The  X  and  Y  registers  may  be  used
independently to  cause  an  address  compare  on  two  specific
addresses, or may be used  together to compare on a  reference
to a location  between the addresses in the two  registers.
The compare condition  can be  either read or  write or  both,
independently for X and  Y. The X and  Y registers have 18  bits
each for the  address and  two bits to  indicate whether  the
for the setting the read and write compare conditions.
The  control register  contains two  bits to  set
compare on read and/or  write between the  X and Y  registers.
The control register also has an interrupt enable bit, a  bit
to indicate that an enabled  address compare has occured,  a
bit to  inhibit the  UNIBUS INIT  signal from  reseting  the
device and  4  bits for  freezing  the history  memory.  The
history memory count register controls which history  memory
location  is  currently  available  in  the  history  memory
register; it also controls which history memory location  is
written into next. When the history memory is not frozen the
history memory  count register  is incremented  after  every
memory reference.

Hardware Description

	The MB11 is a standard quad high module. It plugs
into a regular SPC slot and uses the normal power supplies.
The UNIBUS address, interrupt vector address and interrupt
level are all user setable. The device represents 8 words
on the UNIBUS. The low order 4 bits of the UNIBUS address
select the register, the high order 5 bits of the UNIBUS
address must be ones and the middle 9 bits of UNIBUS address
are settable by switches. The MB11 may interrupt through
any vector 0 through 374, setable by switches. The interrupt
level is selected by the standard DEC interrupt level jumpers.
Level 7 is recomended.
	It should be noted that the MB11, being a UNIBUS device,
will only notice references made to memory that is on the UNIBUS.
This is not a problem on most PDP11s, but the MB11 will not
notice references to bipolar or MOS memory on the PDP11/45,
nor will it notice references to memory on the PDP11/70
memory bus. Also, since the LSI11 (and the PDP11/03) doesn't
have a UNIBUS, the MB11 cannot be used with them.

Programming the MB11

	The MB11 consists of 8 UNIBUS addressable registers.
These registers may be read as  words or bytes, but must  be
written only  as  full  words. The  first  register  is  the
control register.

	The  freeze  bits  will  inhibit  storing  into  the
history memory if any  of them are on.  They can be used  to
temporarilly inhibit  the  history  memory on  entry  to  an
interrupt or  debugging  routine.  In the  case  of  interrupt
routines, there is a problem that the history memory can  be
quickly filled by an  interrupt routine immediately before  a
compare  event  occurs  in  the  main  program.  This   should
not ordinarily be too  serious, but it can  be minimized  if
desired by  placing an  INC  MBCSR at  the entrance  to each
interrupt routine and a  DEC MBCSR just  before the exit.  In
this way  only  a  few  history  memory  locations  will  be
clobbered by  the interrupt  routine.  If the  address  compare
condition occurs in  the interrupt routine  it will still  be
clear that this has happened from the history memory because
the instrution fetches for the INC will be recorded  but the
fetch for the RTT  or RTI will  not be. If  it is not  clear
where in the interrupt  routine the address compare  happened
it will be nessesary to remove  the INC and DEC and run  the
program again. If the compare occurs in an interrupt routine
that interrupted out of an inerrupt routin that had INCed the
control register, things will be rather confusing.
The debugging program  should also  INC  the
MBCSR as the  first instruction  it executes  to ensure  the
maximum  number  of  references  before  the  entry  to  the
debugger can be examined (in the case where the debugger was
entered from a BPT or trace trap, or manually started). Note
that care must be exercised  to ensure that the register  is
not decremented  when  the freeze  bits  are all  zero!
	The
interrupt enable bit controls whether the MB11 will  interrupt
or not  when an  address compare  condition occurs.  If  the
interrupt enable  is set  an address  compare will  cause  an
interrupt if the processor level  is lower than the  interrupt
level of the MB11. The history  memory is frozen even if  an
interrupt cannot be generated so  that the exact location  of
the address compare can be determined even if the program is
running at a  higher level than  the MB11 is  wired to.  The
address compare bit is set by one of the six address compare
conditions occuring; it  can be   reset by  writing a   zero
into the  bit, but cannot be set by the  program. The  X<address<Y
read and  write  bits enable address  compares on reads  and
writes in  between the locations specified  by the  X and  Y
registers. The  Inhibit INIT bit inhibits the  effect of the
UNIBUS INIT signal  on the MB11;  if the bit is not set  the
control register will  be cleared by  the INIT signal  which
can be generated  by a RESET  instruction. With the  Inhibit
INIT bit set it is  possible to have address compares   remain
set  despite  the  INIT   signal;  the  control register  is
always reset on  powering up,   however. Note that only  the
control register is  reset on power  up and INIT if the Inhibit
INIT bit is clear; the other registers
must  be reset by  the program if  their contents are to  be
predictable.
	The interrupt on almost overflow bit enables an
interrupt to occur when the history memory counter reaches
56 (70 octal). When this bit is set the history memory counter
overflow bit will cause the histroy memory to be frozen.
The use of this bit is described in the section describing
the count register.

	The X and  Y registers are  each implemented as  two
UNIBUS registers. Registers 7xxxx2 and  7xxxx4 are the X register  and
registers 7xxxx6  and 7xxx10  are  the Y  register. The  low  numbered
register of each pair contains  the high order address  bits
and the read and write compare enables.

	When MSYN occurs on the UNIBUS (indicating the start
of a  memory cycle)  the MB11  compares the  address on  the
UNIBUS with the contents of the X and Y registers. If the  X
or Y register contains exactly the same address as is on the
UNIBUS an address compare condition will occur if the  cycle
is an enabled one, e.g. if the X register matches to  UNIBUS
address and the cycle  is a read and  the X register  enable
compare on read bit is set, and address compare will  occur.
Similarly, if the address is greater than the X register and
less than the Y  register an address  compare will occur  if
the cycle is of a type  enabled in the control register.  It
should be  noted  that some  PDP11  instructions do  a  read
before they do a write, e.g.  BIS.  Note also that the  MB11
completely ignores  bit 0  of the  UNIBUS address  and  that
there is  no  provision  for  distinguishing  a  byte  cycle
(DATAOB) from a full word cyle (DATAO).
	The history memory counter register (7xxx16) is used
as the address pointer into the history memory.

	The 6 low order bits of the register act as the address
bits for the 64 word history memory. When the history
memory is not frozen (control register bits 7, 3, 2, 1 and 0
are all clear) every memory reference will have its address
stored in the history memory and will cause the counter
register to be incremented by 1. The counter is always incremented
after the address is stored, so the counter points to the next
location to be stored into. If the reference causes a freeze
the counter will still increment due to that reference.
If a memory reference clears a freeze condition it will
not be stored in the history memory, nor will it cause the
counter to increment. The counter is a writeable register;
the low six bits may be set to any desired value. All writes
to this register will clear the overflow bit; the overflow bit
is only set by the counter going from all ones to all zeros.
Setting the overflow bit has no effect unless the interupt on
overflow bit is set in the control register. If that bit is set,
setting the overflow bit will freeze the history memory.
The contents of the counter control what history memory location
may be examined in the history memory register. The history memory
register is implemented as two UNIBUS registers.

	When the debugging program is entered it should INC the
control register to make sure the history memory is frozen.
If the debugger was entered by an address compare compare
the history memory was of course already frozen; if it was
not the last three history memory locations will contain
the record of the INC. The debugging program should
also have commands for examining the history memory.
In order to implement this, the debugging program should
store the value of the history memory counter register
when it is entered; if the user requests printout of the
n th previous reference, the debugging program loads
<stored history memory counter>-(n+1) mod 64 into the history
memory counter and prints the contents of the history memory
register.
	The purpose of the overflow bit in the history
memory counter is to allow a very sophisticated debugging
program, or a timesharing system to control the history
memory. When the debugging program returns control
to the program being debuged after, for example, a breakpoint,
it must unfreeze the history memory before returning. If
the program being debugged returns after only a few
instructions the history memory will contain both the references
made by the debugger while returning to the program and the
references made by the program. A smart debugger could elminate
the references it made from the history memory by useing
a more complicated history memory examining command than
was described above. By clearing the history memory counter
register before unfreezing the history memory the debugger
can examine the overflow bit on reentry to determine if
the program made more than 64 references; if it did not,
then the debugger will only consider the last <counter>-<number
of references made by debugger in returning> entrys in the
history memory to be valid references. If the debugger
had stored the previous contents of the history memory
the user could have the apperance of a long history
memory even though the debugging program had wiped out
part of the real history memory.
A similar technique could be used in a timeshareing system
to make the history memory appear to be not disturbed
by a scheduling operation.
	In conjunction with the interupt on almost overflow bit
in the control register the history memory counter can be used to
simulate an arbitraily large history memory. When the interrupt
due to the near overflow of the counter occurs a routine
can save the contents of the history memory, reset the counter
and continue the program. The reason for the interrupt occuring
on the counter reaching 56 (70 octal) rather than on overflow
is that the overflow may occur at the begining of the execution
of an instruction, in which case the last references the instruction
makes would be lost, since the interupt cannot happen
until the instruction is completed.
