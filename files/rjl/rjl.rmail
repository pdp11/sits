Please look at TOPS.PUB[1,BH] (or TOPS.XGP if you're brave).  It's
a draft proposal for a TOPS-10 display service which I intend to
send to DEC as a follow-up to the conversations I had with them on
the subject last week.  I would appreciate comments within the
next couple of days while I'm still here.  Tnx.

I talked to someone at ECD today.  The latest word is:
1) Descriptive material should be available tomorrow 12/11;
where will be posted.
2) Hardware will probably not be available till end of January
because TV required FCC approval!!! (uses RF energy).
3) Course will be taught during IAP to anyone; not just those
that sign up for the hardware; although there may be a number

	I don't see how it can hurt to try returning it.  The very worst
that could happen is that we would never see it or the money again, which,
since it has been copied, wouldn't be so bad.   I suspect that it will be 
bureaucrattically treated as a piece of returned merchandise without
any individual consideration at all.  
	I agreed to pay for half the pins, so send me half unless you feel
the need for more for your own use.

from: hgb@ml  re: Spencer Love's micro-computer
I talked to Spencer on 12/2 and he told me the following info:
1) The initial order for parts has already been placed for 200
systems.  The first 150 of those have already been taken.  On
12/12 the other 50 places in the course will be filled on a
first-come first-serve basis.  Information will be posted.
However, as a special deal for MAC hackers, Spencer will be
placing another order which will be available towards the end of
IAP.  So even if you miss out on the original 200, MAC types can
still get in on the price, albeit at the later delivery.
2) Only MIT types, or those with an MIT sponser can participate,
since the money goes through the Bursar's office.
3) The TV interface will have a programmable character generator
(8 x 12) consisting of 6 4x4 pixels.  Thus, with enough memory,
you can have the SAIL character set (or worse).  Also, if you
can get a Knight-type TV, the interface will support the larger
number of characters, with a corresponding increase in memory
requirements.

Date: 1 DEC 1975 0212-PST
From: Whit Diffie (WD @ SU-AI)
To:   RJL @ MIT-AI

	Why don't you just send me the lock parts and some of the pins.  That is
probably easier than sending you data about the key.  I also need some of the
C and E blanks we bought last year.  I will be hapy to pay for the better set
of picks, but if you want to sell me yours  and keep the new set while ordering
another, go right ahead.
	I definitely want the S&G catalog.  I trust it is not a ripoff.  I think
I might as well order the manipulation book from LL.  I don't recommend using
Oro as the notary.  Your bank will probably notarize something for you. That
is what I always do.  I think any notary, including paying a random one $2 or
whatever it currently is would be better than using Oro.
	I think that if additional charts are needed for Art of Manip., that
I would write back, taking the atitude that the order is incomplete.  The
obvious thing to do if we can get away with it is to xerox it and return it.
I don't know what their return policy is, but I should think that the charts
business gives you at least a small wedge.  At any event, why don't you
xerox, without leaving marks if possible, and send me a copy.
	I am naturally anxious to get a look at the rest of the books.  For those,
I suggest that you make a copy for yourself and send me the originals.  I am 
hot to see them, but I don't really have much time.
	I decided to offer to pay the whole bill, rather than trying to get 
together a consortium, because I wanted the originals, and it seemed simpler.
I think the total book cost will come to about $150.  If you and Knight and
Sussman are willing to pay something for the copying rights, I will
certainly be grateful.
	I think I have covered all the points, perhaps not too clearly.
I will be logged in again on tuesday night.  I have your relocking device
packed to mail.
					Give my regards to Pat,

Re: IAP #374 -- Build Yourself a Microcomputer for $150
Update:
	I want to thank all of you who have sent me mail about
this project.  However, I want to make several things clear:
	1) I am not running it.  Spencer Love is running it in
conjunction with a company called ECD.  All orders and
preregistration must be made through him.  He can be contacted
at (617)-253-1000 x5-6663.  I will, however, forward all
addresses that have been sent to me so far to him.
	2) As far as I know, this activity will be restricted to
those who can take part in MIT's Independent Activities Period
(IAP) during January.  The parts are being offered at this
rock-bottom price because they want you to be guinea pigs in
building and testing this kit.  If you aren't around, it is hard
to learn anything from you.
	3) From the response I have gotten just from ML, AI, and
DM, there is a big market out there for some enterprising
capitalist!

Re: IAP #374 -- Build Yourself a Microcomputer for $150
Spencer Love is running an IAP activity in which you can
build your own microcomputer for $150.  The output is to an
un-hacked TV, mass storage done on an un-hacked audio cassette
recorder.  The system includes:
1) MCS 6501 (or 6502) 8-bit microcomputer;
2) 4K memory, additional 4K $60;
3) keyboard;
4) interface to TV;
5) interface to cassette;
6) cassette with assembler, BASIC, and editor;
7) pre-wired circuit boards and power supply;
8) Graphics capability, phone interface only "a little more".
See IAP Guide activity #374 for more details.
	If you want this microcomputer, Spencer needs to know
by Dec. 12 in order to have the parts available.  Contact him
at X5-6663.
	I am taking an informal poll of the people around MAC
who are interested.  Please send me mail at HGB`ML.

Ask Jack about the SUDS documentation tangle, he created it by
trying to format the original SUDS.TXT to make it more readable.  I tried
to get together with Helliwell about the documentation.  I offered to put it
in PUBable form  with some whizzy PUB macroes to
make the PUB source human readable, but RPH was not enthusiastic about the idea
since he does not have a running PUB at DEC.  As you no doubt realize, the
three sites MIT, SAIL, and DEC have no no document preparation
system in common.  PUB is somewhat more desirable because of its indexing and
macro capability.  Perhaps, you would like to do something about the situation
or you could get someone else intereste?

There are a few things that I have noticed while hacking with SLOGO
that are in no immediate need of being fixed, yet I thought I would
mention them.

2) When typed, ^L becomes part of a line. Program control of clearing
the screen is nice, but a better way is needed.

3) Since there is now a backarrow in the large font there is no way to 
genereate an underline. Both would be nice.

4) There are some strange control characters that have been imported 
with the large font (such as lambda!!). I am not particularly bothered
by them but I am sure a kid would not be very happy to see such strange 
things.

5) System functions that have not been implemented should return the
same error message as would occour if someone typed FOO and FOO was not
defined.

Well, these are the only things that bug me at the moment.

There is one suggestion for DDT though; it would be nice to have DDT type
a carrige return at you when you typed $P at it so that you know that it
is listening.

Ron,
	Bliss-11 was submitted to DECUS several months ago.  I can
send you a manual (+ update files), but if you want a number of
manuals it is better to get them from DEC.  As for bliss-11's current
viability, things look very good.  People from all over CMU and
(what warms my heart much more) a number of non-CMU sites are making
substantial use of it, bringing up all kinds of device controllers,
interfaces, language processors, etc.

 	It has five little geared whels.  Whenever a button is pressed, the
 associated wheel is moved one notch.  In addition, all wheels which have
 already moved from their starting positions are also advanced one notch.
 Example: Call the wheels I, II, III, IV, and V.
 Punch the combination: II, (I V), III. ie. two alone followed by one and five
 together followed by three alone.
 When the lock is cleared: I=0, II=0, III=0, IV=0, V=0.
 After II is pushed: I=0, II=1, III=0, IV=0, V=0.
 After (I V) are pushed simulaniously: I=1, II=2, III=0, IV=0, V=1.
 After III is pushed: I=2, II=3, III=1, IV=0, V=2.
 	Settin the combination is s?mply a matter of rotating the wheels so that
 the desired state(above is 2,3,1,0,2) lines up a set of slots.
 	I haven't subjected the combinatorics to any analysis.  I presume there
 is only one way of dialing any combination.  I suspect that the number of 
 combinations is increased by allowing more than one push per button under
 the same scheme.  The maximum with the present five butttons and five slots
 per wheel would be 5^5=3125, or only three times the present 1082.  I am not
 sure if that maximum would be achievable by this scheme.  I also haven't 
 analysed the effect of increasing the number of teeth per wheel.  Gosper
 worked out the recurrence relation for the number of combinations possible
 with n buttons one push per button.  It grows rapidly with the number of
 buttons(oh to have seven fingers).  I don't have the formula here, but will
 find it if you like.  I hope the explanation is comprehensible.
